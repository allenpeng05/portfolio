          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Allen Peng, and I am Computer Science major /
            Mathematics minor passionate about building things that are useful
            and elegant. I was born in Boulder, CO(SKO Buffs), but moved to
            Arizona when I was young. I currently go to school in Southern
            California, and am trying to take advantage of the amazing weather
            while I'm here.
